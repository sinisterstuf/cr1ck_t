VelocityDenominator = 10    ; the bigger this is, the longer you have to hold jump to reach the next level of "jump strength" aka priming
VelocityXMultiplier = 2     ; how many times further it should move sideways than up when jumping
MaxPrime            = 5     ; should have been called max level of jump strength
DebugMode           = false ; sets whether to display additional debugging info on the screen during playing the game or not
